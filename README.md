###Overview

###Compiling and Using

###Testing

    Tesing has involved the following:

        Printing the Parent pre and post split
        Printing left and right children
        Printing the key being inserted
        Printing the frequency of any given key

###Discussion

###Sources Used

###TODO:

    #BTREE CLASS
         Write function:
            Should write the root node and/or whole BTree to a binary file. Reference spec sheet
            for info.

         Read function:
            Reads in the root node when the program starts. Not sure of the purpose.
            Again, reference spec sheet for info.

         Implement Cache:
            Self-Explanatory

     #QUERY CLASS:
            This class chould reference BTree and be able to see how many times
            any subsequece has happened.
  READ ---> Ryan: working on Query. Base class should be nearly finished. Need read/write
            done for testing. Read/Write should be the next step.

     #OPTIONAL!!
     ------------
     ###FINISHED : #toString function: GeneConverter Class
            This function should be able to convert the binary strings created in toLong to
            regular characters.
                Ryan: ###FINISHED. Will be used to implement the query class.
                      May also be used for read/write testing.

     ANYTHING ELSE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SHOULD BE ADDED TO THIS README!! MAKE NOTES AS TASKS ARE COMPLETED.
